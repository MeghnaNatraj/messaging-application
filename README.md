# Messaging Application Setup Manual

Message is a messaging application that uses node.js and socket.io to create a simple messaging application that provides a chat window for multiple users.
As we use node.js, we have a non-blocking I/O which helps us create a lock-free,thread-free, easy to set-u,use and run application.
